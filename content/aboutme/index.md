_Welcome_ to my website! Here I talk about my engineering projects and create small tutorials on technology, carpentry and other eclectic hobbies of mine. To reach me, don't hesitate to reach out to me at steedmanwill@gmail.com.

## Who am I?

![First](images/first.jpeg)

I am a third mechatronics engineering student at Queen's University. I chose mechatronics engineering because of the depth of opportunity for creativity and learning it has. Outside of my design projects I love weightlifting, the summer, carpentry, music (indie rock is my favorite) and reading. My favourite book right now is "Make it Stick by Roediger III, Henry and Brown".

Here is my life in photos:

I have played hockey since I was four. I loved it so much back then that I used to wear a helmet in public, much to my parents' horror. Sorry Mom and Dad.

My friend Griff and I! Griff is my families' 7-year old Boston Terrier. He loves cheese.

## Why a Website?

I see this website as an opportunity for me to document my life as a student and person. I am hoping to look back when I am older and appreciate how much progress I have made! It also allows me to connect with other people with shared interests. Last, it feels nice to share projects and ideas that I am proud of!
