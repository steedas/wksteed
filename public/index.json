My coworker Eric and I characterised the hand-tracking accuracy of the Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 using a KUKA LBR iiwa R7 robotic manipulator as a proxy for a human hand/arm. Our results showed landmark tracking accuracy on the order of ~1.12 cm for the Quest Pro and ~1.73cm for the Quest 3, which are some of the highest accuracy results for any measured virtual reality headset. The technology is getting really good.\nOur third test is designed to see how long it takes for motion from the hand to be displayed in the headset lenses. This delay is measured by counting the number of frames between when the robot passes a certain point (the blue ring around the end effector turns on) and the lens detects the robot at that point (the VR headset lens changes color from blue to purple)\n","date":"23 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/vrhandtracking/","section":"Posts","summary":"Using a KUKA cobot as a tool for designing repeatable hand-tracking experiments","title":"Characterizing VR Headset Performance with Cobots","type":"projects"},{"content":"Side projects, books, and things I think about\n","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogposts/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"","title":"Blog Posts","type":"blogposts"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogposts/speakerman/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"Your loud home speaker companion","title":"ChatterBox","type":"blogposts"},{"content":"","date":"7 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogposts/learning/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"My attempts and insights on learning processes","title":"Effort, Learning and Efficiency","type":"blogposts"},{"content":"I joined QVEX during my second year at Queen\u0026rsquo;s. At QVEX, we build competetive wheeled robots that can launch and catch projectiles, climb poles, and complete other game-related tasks, sometimes autonomously. As part of a mechanical design team, I assisted in development of reliable projectile intake and launching mechanisms that helped us to qualify and compete at the VEX U World Championships in Dallas.\nOur match against Florida Southern College during Worlds\nExperience, Learning \u0026amp; Skills # 24\u0026quot; Worlds Robot (left), 15\u0026quot; Worlds Robot (right)\nExperience \u0026amp; Skills # Collaborated with \u0026gt;10 engineering students using Onshape, Solidworks and Solidworks Simulation to design, prototype, manufacture and assemble four wheeled robots in 8 months\nExperimented with new mechanisms including rack \u0026amp; pinions, slip gears, chain and sprocket drives\nDeveloped skills for defending ideas, convincing colleagues of optimal strategies and communicating effectively\nLearning # Integration is hard: CADding an entire system on your own is easy because you have an idea in your head of where each subsystem fits. CADding a system as a team is harder because every designer has their own ideas in their head of where each subsystem fits. Staying organized and making sure everyone is one the same page is a must-have for coherent final designs.\nA design is not done until it is tested: We ran out of time to thoroughly test our mechanisms for our Worlds Robots. As a consequence, we got destroyed in compettion at Worlds. We all consumed a little bit too much of what I like to call hopium. It probably isn\u0026rsquo;t in any dictionary, but maybe it should be. Hopium: Irrational optimism and denial of Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law: \u0026ldquo;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong\u0026rdquo;.\nBeware the sunk-cost bias: Robots are challenging to design and take some time to get right. This past year, we made mistakes by building the mechanisms that were strategically inferior for the game. However, because we spent so long developing these mechanisms, we fell in favor of them. Assessing your decisions at every stage of the design process can allow you to catch biases and make sure your decisions are grounded in what is best for the team\nMotivation # Why join QVEX? I joined for the experience and the people. I have learned a lot about team management, collaborative design, the mechanical design process and novel mechanisms. The opportunity has given me the chance to meet a lot of great and talented people interested in designing cool things. I would reccomend the experience for anyone interested in making things happen in robotics.\nTechnical Details # VEX makes a new game every year. The \u0026lsquo;23-\u0026lsquo;24 game was called Over Under. You get points for putting game objects (a green releaux tetrahedron, A.K.A triball) under a net. Our robots\u0026rsquo; strategies were to lob balls from one robot to the other and fire them under the net. Basically, alley-oop robots.\nHere is what I mean\nWe had a 15\u0026quot; robot and a 24\u0026quot; robot. Note that a lot of the things that I am showing off were not designed by me. Everyone involved (not just mechanical) deserve a lot of credit: Patrick, Michael, James, Theo, Cole, Maxim, Avery, Peter, Ryan, Nikola, Koen, Cass, Laura, Taylor, Xan, Becca, Ben, Liam, Cal, Callum, Evan, Kieran, Mike, Nick and everyone else I missed.\nOur 15\u0026quot; robot was super innovative this year. Our key features were a 3D-printed differential swerve drive and a rotating, cascading net.\nOur 24\u0026quot; robot was a lot bigger and more of a classic VEX style. Tank drive and almost 40lbs. Hard to move and designed to play defense and push around other robots.\nIntakes # What and How # In Over Under, our team\u0026rsquo;s strategy was to launch triballs (the green releaux tetrahedrons from previous videos) from a loading zone over the field and into the other robot. We needed a system to reliably intake triballs from the loading zone into the robot so they could be launched by our flywheel system across the field. To do this, I designed a 6-wheel flex-wheel intake using chain and sprockets to suck game objects into our robot.\nThe final design\nIf interested, the video below highlights some of the features of the intakes and why they exist\nIssues and Solutions # We ran into a some technical issues before achieving a \u0026gt;95% success rate system. Here are the main ones:\nFriction: VEX Motors aren\u0026rsquo;t very powerful and overheat when put under stress. We wanted our intakes to be fast and therefore needed a low gearbox reduction to achieve high speeds. Low gearbox reduction decreased available torque, making us particularly susceptible to motor stalling when exposed to oppositional forces. Using properly tensioned bearings and reducing shaft normal forces allowed us to reduce system friction. System Testing\nTuning (Materials and Geometry): A lot of tuning had to be done with this design as a consequence of the geometry of the game object. Triballs have vastly different horizontal and vertical dimensions depending on their orientation. Consequently, designs must be capable of handling all different orientations without jamming to guarantee reliability. We spent a lot of time playing around with the material of the wheels, the horizontal distance between the two intake units and the vertical location of the wheels relative to the hubs. Here is an example of a failed attempt. The interaction between the triballs and the belts caused belt slipping in this version\nLinear Puncher V4 # What and How # Another project I helped design was a linear puncher mechanism. The purpose is to launch the triballs across the field by punching them with an aluminum rod. The underlying mechanism is a rack and slip-pinion that is elastically banded. Here is the idea from a sketch.\nThe final design features a torque reduction to allow us to use more bands, a TPU-based impact pad, and a doubly-reinforced, hand-made alumnium puncher.\nIssues and Solutions # The video below shows the iteration cycle for this design. A lot of the iterations had to due with impact management of the rack against the frame.\nAn optimization of this design that I didn\u0026rsquo;t cover in the video was the geometry of the puncher. We were having issues where the aluminum rod was bending after contacting the triball. On the left (red side) is what we were experiencing, and on the right (green side) was our proposed solution.\nTo see how much better using two plates separated by a spacer is than one, we can calculate the area moment of inertia of both systems. The area moment of inertia is inversely proportional to the beam deflection by the following relation:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{FL^3}{EI}$$Where F is the force applied from the triball, L is the length of the puncher rod, E is the Young\u0026rsquo;s Modulus of 6061 Aluminum and I is the area moment inertia of the puncher\nSuppose we make the puncher rod twice as thick. How does that change our system\u0026rsquo;s deflection?\nOption A deflection calculations:\n$$I_{\\text{A}}={Ld^3}$$$$\\sigma_{\\text{max , A}}=\\frac{FL^3}{ELd^3}$$Option B deflection calculations:\n$$I_{\\text{B}} = L((4d)^3-(2d)^3)$$$$I_{\\text{B}} = 56Ld^3$$$$\\sigma_{\\text{max , B}}=\\frac{FL^3}{56ELd^3}$$When compared:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{max , B}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{max , A}}}=\\frac{\\frac{FL^3}{56ELd^3}}{\\frac{FL^3}{ELd^3}}$$$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{max , B}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{max , A}}} = \\frac{1}{56}$$This means that increasing the thickness of the puncher rod twofold decreases the beam deflection 56 times! When we implemented this on our punchers we experienced virtually no deflection.\nHere are the final puncher systems on both of the robots that qualified us to the world championships.\n","date":"11 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/vexoverunder/","section":"Posts","summary":"Designing reliable mechanisms for the VEX U World Championships in Dallas","title":"Fail-Proofing Mechanisms for Wheeled Robots","type":"projects"},{"content":"I always have a messy desk. To fix this, I designed, assembled and coded an open-source, four degree-of-freedom, half-meter workspace, 2kg payload, 3D-printed robot arm that can pick up objects and wipe countertops.\nExperience, Learning \u0026amp; Skills # Final CAD for Goose V1\nExperience \u0026amp; Skills # I followed Shigley\u0026rsquo;s Engineering Design Process through many iterations of mechanical, electrical and software design.\nI developed skills in full-assembly mechanical design in Solidworks, how to modularize and parameterize parts, electronic circuit design and debugging, interfacing electronic hardware with microcontrollers, and elementary robotic control (FKin and IKin).\nLearning # Be dumb enough to start but smart enough to learn - I didn\u0026rsquo;t think too hard about starting a larger project like this one or else I would have scared myself off from actually doing it. I found that it is best to embrace the unknown and adapt quickly to design problems as they present themselves.\nDesign parts to fail (CAD+physically) - I probably iterated on the wrist design for the project 20 times. Each time I began a new Solidworks part, imported my motors and other accessories, and re-designed from scratch. This was agonizingly inefficient. The trick I found is to fix high-level geometry ASAP and paramaterize sketches around that geometry. This way, you can work within one part and only change sketch dimensions as opposed to changing whole parts. The other part of this story is modularizing parts to facilitate easy part exchanges. When a super large, hard-to-reach part breaks it can set you back a long time to re-manufacture and assemble. By designing discrete, exchangable and spatio-dynamically thoughtful parts you save a lot of time and headache.\nMotivation # I think robot arms are beautiful paradoxes; complicated in most engineering aspects, but perform tasks like picking up objects that are ostensibly so simple. This project was motivated to explore and learn from these engineering complexities and attempt to execute some simple tasks like picking up objects and following trajectories.\nAbove is a video of one fascination I had was the mechanical complexity of spherical wrists. Designiners have to be creative to find a way to trasmit rotation from revolute actuators typically located at the elbows to mutually perpendicular wrist joints.\nTechnical Details # Mechanical # Mechanical design took about 6 months to dial in. I iterated around 15 times towards more optimal (but certainly not perfect) design features. I determined that belts were advantageous to introduce because they allowed me to position heavy motors near the end of joints to offset the weight of other linkages.\nSince I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any closed-loop control on my motors (I chose open-loop because it was cheaper) I had to introduce some other strategy to guarantee that my linkages were in the right spot relative to their end-stops. I used limit switches (buttons) to achieve this.\nI decided on using a linear rail rack-and-pinion gripper system. I took inspiration from Chris Annin\u0026rsquo;s design. It works well and it has some tactility because the servo can detect when it is beginning to stall. The solution isn\u0026rsquo;t super repsonsive, though, and could be improved by adding a legit force sensor on the prong.\nFor scale, here is Goose V1 compared to some more legitimate robots from KUKA\u0026rsquo;s fleet, with a human for scale.\nElectrical # The electronics architecture was governed by the sensor and actuator selection from the mechanical design. I needed two 36V, 480W power supplies connected in parallel to actuate the four NEMA stepper motors (3x NEMA 23, 1x NEMA 17) and their drivers. This power supply setup has enough power to independently power some microwaves or small ovens.\nStepper motor drivers are signal translators. They take in high-level pulse input signals from a microcontroller (in my case, a Teensy 4.1) and translate these signals into stepped-up, high-fidelity square-wave pulses that the motor can use to move. They also act like a safe-guard and prevent any voltage spikes from damaging the motors. Evidently, they are pretty important for motor performance.\nAs the microcontroller inputs square wave pulses (top), the stepper driver outputs stepped up sinusoids. You can adjust the resolution of the output to be smoother if your application needs. As your resolution (the amount of microsteps/step) increases, the output pulses resemble smooth sinusoids more and more. The trade off of having high resolution is that you experience reduced torque.\nAfter blowing up several A4988 drivers (which I had a lot of trouble working with reliably), I bought the bullet and got some more expensive StepperOnline DM556T and DM542T drivers that accomodated my voltage and current specs. I enclosed all the electronics in a case for compactness. I learned that my cable management skills need work!\nThe last notable electronics optimization was the microcontroller itself. I originally was using an old Arduino ATMega board but discovered that the Teensy 4.1 had way more appealing features. Mostly, its 600MHz clock speed and 1024K SRAM appealed to me because it would make algorithm computation super fast, leading to smoother arm kinematics.\nThe Teensy 4.1 performs 330.57 times better than a standard Arduino Mega when tested on a CoreMark CPU Benchmark\nSoftware # I started by developing a homing algorithm so I could command each joint to its physical limit. This invovled moving each linkage in the direction of its limit switch until pressing its position.\nMy mathematical model for this project was quite crude. I made a lot of simplications in order to make the computations simpler and faster. First, I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the orientation of the end effector, only its position. Second, I approximated the three linkage robot as an open-chain dual linkage. I made this approximation because it left with me two variables to solve for instead of three.\nUsing this model, FKin became trivial because it was simply a matter of plugging in Theta1 and Theta2 into the two nonlinear equations in the diagram.\nI solved for my IKin solution by solving for Theta1 in terms of Theta2 and iterating through all possible values of Theta1 to find one that has the least mathematical error.\nMy model and solution are computationally inefficient and geometrically inaccurate. They were good enough for the purposes of this project but in the future, I hope to work more on manipulator control. I had some errors in my linkage angles, which I believe are most likely a consequence of poor belt geometry, belt slipping and rotor slipping under load.\nI learned a lot from this project! I have been reading Robot Modelling and Control by Spong and hope to apply the ideas in a future project.\n","date":"29 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/goosev1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Using CAD, math and coding to give me an extra hand with chores","title":"Designing a 3D Printed Robot Arm to Clean My Room","type":"projects"},{"content":"As part of the vehicle dynamics subteam for the Queen\u0026rsquo;s University BAJA SAE Team, I optimized past hub designs using finite element analysis (FEA) to reduce weight by 7% in spite of having material 3.75x weaker than previous years.\nQueen\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;22-\u0026lsquo;23 BAJA Race Car at competition at OktoBajafest in Clarkson, NY\nExperience, Learning \u0026amp; Skills # Experience:\nI was given the opportunity to design, simulate and manufacture the wheel hubs for the \u0026lsquo;22-\u0026lsquo;23 BAJA racer. I collaborated with 10 other engineering students apart of a vehicle dynamics subteam at the Queen\u0026rsquo;s University BAJA Team. Skills:\nI developed skills in Solidworks and SolidCAM during the design and simulation phases of this project. Particularly, I learned how to setup/use FEA for design dynamics validation and ensure our parts could be manufactured using CNC Lessons:\nManufacturing Matters! A dynamically and spatially feasible design doesn\u0026rsquo;t equal a pragmatical design. Without considering manufacturing methods from project inception lots of time can be wasted designing un-makable parts.\nLearn from people. I was fortunate to be mentored by Manny, a then third year Mech. Eng student. He taught me so much about FEA and how to optimize designs. I learned how important it is to ask questions and pay attention to experts around you.\nMotivation # Our team changed metal suppliers at the start of the year. This meant we didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to the uber-strong Aermet Steel (1723N/mm^2) from before. We only had AISI 4130 (460N/mm^2), a much weaker steel. Race car competitions (think F1) are all about making your vehicle as manouverable, light and aerodynamic as possible. We wanted to take our old hubs (from below) and improve them to be lighter and stronger, allowing us to get faster times in competition.\nThe \u0026lsquo;21-\u0026lsquo;22 wheel hubs, without the wheel attached\nTechnical Details # Since we had a CAD from last year, the logical first step was to change the material from AerMet to 4130 and run an FEA on the design to see how it performed. For our loading values we used this paper. I set up an FEA and got these results.\nThis result showed points on the hub where the material would permanently deform (yield) above an acceptable rate (Young\u0026rsquo;s Modulus of AISI 4130, in this case 460 MPa). If we were to remanufacture the hubs w/ the same material we would surely break all of them.\nThis meant we had to iterate! We wanted to keep the same general form (since we knew it was compatible with our current wheels and wheel package) so the iteration included modestly changing spoke geometry.\nI went through five iterations to reduce overall weight by 60g while keeping the hubs compatible with our wheel package. We used Solidworks CAM to make sure our hubs would be manufactureable on an outsourced 5-axis CNC mill.\nThe final hubs looked like this. While you may not be able to even tell, the spoke shape and cutouts look different.\nDue to budget constraints we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to manufacture the hubs during the \u0026lsquo;22-\u0026lsquo;23 season. However, during the \u0026lsquo;23-\u0026lsquo;24 season (barring some more optimizations that I was not apart of) my teammates were able to get these beautiful hubs made.\n","date":"22 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/bajahubs/","section":"Posts","summary":"Designing robust, machined parts for offroad BAJA racecars","title":"Making Race Car Parts Strong Using Simulation","type":"projects"},{"content":" Welcome to my website!
