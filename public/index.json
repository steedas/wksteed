Here I talk about my engineering projects and create small tutorials on technology, carpentry and other eclectic hobbies of mine. To reach me, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me at steedmanwill@gmail.com.\nWho am I? # I am a third mechatronics engineering student at Queen\u0026rsquo;s University. I chose mechatronics engineering because of the depth of opportunity for creativity and learning it has. Outside of my design projects I love weightlifting, the summer, carpentry, music (indie rock is my favorite) and reading. My favourite book right now is \u0026ldquo;Make it Stick by Roediger III, Henry and Brown\u0026rdquo;.\nGallery # Here is my life in photos:\nI have played hockey since I was four. I loved it so much back then that I used to wear a helmet in public, much to my parents\u0026rsquo; horror. Sorry Mom and Dad.\nMy friend Griff and I! Griff is my families\u0026rsquo; 7-year old Boston Terrier. He loves cheese.\nSurfing (behind a boat)\nMixing concrete gets a bit messy\u0026hellip;\nWhy a Website? # I see this website as an opportunity for me to document my life as a student and person. I am hoping to look back when I am older and appreciate how much progress I have made! It also allows me to connect with other people with shared interests. Last, it feels nice to share projects and ideas that I am proud of!\n","date":"8 March 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Will Steedman","summary":"Welcome to my website!","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
